                            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                            <p>In this project, I revisited data from "Xmas Everything," an e-commerce store I previously owned and operated. While running the business, I relied primarily on basic analytics tools provided by platforms like Shopify to make decisions. Now, with a more sophisticated data science toolkit, I've reanalyzed this historical data to extract deeper insights and demonstrate how my analytical capabilities have evolved.</p>
                            
                            <p>The analysis focuses on several key business metrics: revenue trends over time, geographical distribution of orders, conversion rates compared to industry benchmarks, and payment method distribution. Each of these areas provides valuable business intelligence that would have been instrumental in making more informed strategic decisions.</p>
                            
                            <div class="personal-note">
                                <h3>Personal Note</h3>
                                <p>This project was both nostalgic and revelatory. Looking back at the data from my e-commerce venture with new skills and perspectives allowed me to see missed opportunities and validate some of the intuitive decisions I made at the time. It was a powerful demonstration of how my analytical skills have grown over the years and reminded me of the real-world impact data science can have on business outcomes.</p>

                            <h2>Revenue Analysis</h2>
                            <p>The first part of this analysis focused on visualizing total revenue over time to understand sales trends and identify significant patterns in revenue generation.</p>
                            
                            <div class="methodology-step">
                                <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
                                <p>I loaded order data from a Shopify export file, ensuring the 'Paid at' column was in datetime format for accurate timeline plotting. After filtering out orders without payment dates, I used Pandas' groupby functionality to aggregate total revenue by date.</p>
                                <div class="code-snippet">
                                    <pre>

                                <p>I created a time series plot with an orange line representing revenue trends. The visualization includes formatted axes (dates and currency values) and deliberate design choices like removing unnecessary spines to focus attention on the data.</p>

                                    <li>Revenue showed a clear upward trend initially, indicating successful marketing and product-market fit</li>
                                    <li>The sudden decline in revenue coincided with PayPal freezing the store's assets, which significantly impacted operations</li>
                                    <li>The total revenue during this period was substantial, demonstrating the business's potential</li>

                            <h2>Geographical Analysis</h2>
                            <p>To optimize inventory management and improve delivery times, I visualized the geographical distribution of orders across the United States. This was particularly relevant as the store had distribution centers in New Jersey and San Francisco.</p>
                            
                            <div class="methodology-step">

                                <p>This analysis required combining order data with geographical data. I used GeoPandas and a US state shapefile from the Census Bureau to create a geographical representation of order distribution. The initial visualization included all territories, but I later filtered to focus on the continental United States for better clarity.</p>

                                <p>After creating an initial visualization, I made several refinements to improve clarity and focus:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Excluded territories and non-continental states (Alaska, Hawaii) to focus on the main market</li>
                                    <li>Used a color gradient that effectively shows the distribution intensity</li>
                                    <li>Added clear borders between states and appropriate legends</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>Understanding how effectively the store converted visitors into customers was crucial for evaluating marketing performance. This analysis compared Xmas Everything's conversion rate against industry benchmarks.</p>

                                    <li>PayPal processed a significant portion of orders, explaining the substantial impact when these funds were frozen</li>
                                    <li>The reliance on multiple payment processors demonstrated both a risk (vulnerability to freezes) and a benefit (diversification)</li>
                                    <li>The distribution informed a key lesson: maintaining healthy relationships with payment processors is critical for e-commerce operations</li>

                                <p>The geographical analysis clearly explained why the New Jersey warehouse depleted inventory faster than San Francisco. With this data, a more optimal inventory distribution could have been implemented, allocating approximately 70% to the East Coast facility and 30% to the West Coast.</p>

                                <p>The payment method analysis highlighted a critical business vulnerability. Having a substantial portion of orders processed through PayPal created a single point of failure that significantly impacted operations when those funds were frozen. A contingency plan for payment processing would have been valuable.</p>
